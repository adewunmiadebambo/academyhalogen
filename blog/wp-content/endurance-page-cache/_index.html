        <div class="entry-content">
            
<p>Cybersecurity
breach is now a regular occurrence as rarely does a month go by without a major
case hitting the headlines. In Nigeria, like other countries of the world, cybercriminals
are deploying advanced malware and sophisticated tactics that makes it harder
than ever to stop compromises taking place.</p>



<p>Are there
lessons to be learned from the successful breaches? Yes, of course. Applying
them can help businesses mitigate the impact of attacks today and strengthen
their defences against future threats.</p>



<p>Here are some
key lessons that can be learned through staying aware of successful breaches
and trends in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>



<p><strong>Keep Abreast of Vulnerabilities</strong></p>



<p>Most
organisations now have basic security hygiene in place. However, recent
breaches have brought shortcomings in this practice into sharp focus. It is
therefore important for system administrators to constantly update server
software such as operating systems, web applications and plugins.</p>



<p>In May
2017, the WannaCry ransomware strain hit hundreds of thousands of targets
around the world, including the UK’s NHS. The extent of its reach was due in
part to the EternalBlue Windows vulnerability that had been released by hacking
group Shadow Brokers the month before.</p>



<p>Microsoft
had released a patch for the bug in March, but many organisations failed to
apply it, leaving them open to the impact of WannaCry. Soon, Petya/NotPetya
followed, using another Shadow Brokers exploit to impact Ukrainian
infrastructure and huge companies such as shipping giant Maersk.</p>



<p>These
outbreaks demonstrated the speed at which cybercriminals will take advantage of
tools that become available. IT departments must therefore have a robust process
in place to become aware of security vulnerabilities as they are disclosed –
and to apply patches as soon as they’re available.</p>



<p><strong>Emphasise Employee Training</strong></p>



<p>Phishing
remains one of the most common techniques used in attacks. The Verizon 2017
Data Breach Investigations Report found that email was the number-one delivery
vector for malware. One reason for this is that cybercriminals are stepping up
their efforts around social engineering. <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2016/12/02/social-engineering-attacks-compromised/">Two-thirds of organisations</a>&nbsp;have fallen victim to social
engineering attacks, while whaling/CEO fraud is becoming increasingly common as
a way to dupe individuals into making payments into the accounts of
cybercriminals.</p>



<p>Attackers
perceive end users as a weak link in security within organisations, whether
unwittingly or not. As a result, every member staff needs to be trained
effectively to spot the warning signs. The Halogen Group is a </p>



<p><strong>Expose Every Breach</strong></p>



<p>Recall
that INEC had breaches in its IT infrastructures during the 2015 general
elections in Nigeria. Towards the end of 2017, Uber acknowledged that a major
data leak had compromised 57 million user accounts. The company also admitted
it had paid hackers $100,000 to conceal and destroy the stolen data. The way
Uber dealt with the breach led to its chief security officer leaving his post
and resulted in an investor consortium offering 30 per cent less than share
value for a stake in the company.</p>



<p>A similar
incident occurred when credit-rating agency Equifax waited until September 2017
to report a hack of 143 million personal information records that had taken
place in July of that year. The company’s CEO, CIO and CSO all resigned once it
became clear that there had been a delay in reporting the incident. The company
also incurred costs of $87m as a result of the breach. Today, numerous
government investigations are ongoing related to the incident.</p>



<p>It is
likely that these breaches would not have been so severe if these organisations
had been upfront about them. The resulting fallout has had a detrimental effect
on reputational trust as much as on revenue and other costs. Businesses should
therefore be transparent when they suffer a security breach. This is
particularly important considering the arrival of the GDPR in May this year,
after which breaches involving the data of EU nationals need to be reported
within 72 hours.</p>



<p><strong>Become More Sophisticated</strong></p>



<p>Generally,
recent breaches suggest that many organisations need to become more
sophisticated in their security capabilities. For instance, two-factor
authentication can severely reduce phishing risks, as it makes stolen
credentials extremely difficult to use. And mobile devices increasingly linked
into corporate networks should be encrypted to ensure confidential data that’s
contained, communicated and accessed by them is difficult for third parties to
obtain.</p>



<p>Segmented
corporate networks, with authentication required to move between segments,
would also make it harder for attackers to get at the data they’re after,
making it too costly and time-consuming for them to pursue.</p>



<p>At the
very least, organisations need to be diligent about updating critical systems
with the latest patches. They need to be committed to developing and delivering
effective cybersecurity training to the workforce. And they must have plans in
place for how to report and respond to successful breaches.</p>



<p>Beyond
that, it’s also smart to have a security incident and event management (SIEM)
system in place, with relevant network monitoring and user and entity behaviour
analytics (UEBA). Such systems will leave organisations much better prepared to
rapidly detect and respond to compromises when they do take place.</p>

            <p>In our new online world, cyber security is fast becoming one of the most critical issues for everyone. The need for steadfast solutions has become even more important as increasing number of businesses are going digital with cyber criminals becoming far more brazen and sophisticated.</p>
<p>There have been serious repercussions for large enterprise organisations since cyber-attacks (and attackers) are becoming more prolific and dangerous. For instance, 1.9 billion data records were breached in the first half of 2017 alone. This means that, on average, 122 records were lost or stolen every second.</p>
<p>As regulatory pressures increase, a key focus for organisations is to build resilience and develop contingency plans to tackle risks. Still, the imperative to protect vital customer data, intellectual property, trade secrets, business strategies market value hangs in the balance.</p>
